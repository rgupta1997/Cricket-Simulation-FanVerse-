# ðŸ›‘ AI Instruction: Do NOT start the development server

The Vite development server is **already running** for this project.  
**Do not execute** `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or any server start command.

- If you need to build or preview, use:
    - `npm run build` for production build
    - `npm run preview` for previewing the build
    - but don't build our app suggest to build

**Any attempt to start the server will result in port conflicts and is unnecessary.**

> âœ… Focus on feature development, debugging, or code editing only.

- Always use pure functions and stateless components for all new code.
- Avoid class-based React components and imperative code patterns.
- Prefer arrow functions, immutability, and composition.
- All position management logic must be implemented as pure functions.
