# 🌱 Green Field Extension - Visual Improvement

## What Was Changed

Extended the **green grass field surface** from 30m radius to **50m radius** to cover the entire playable area.

## 🎯 **Before vs After**

### **BEFORE:**
```
🏟️ Stadium Wall (65m)
  🏏 Boundary Rope (55m)  
    🟫 Brown/Dirt Area (30m-55m)
      🟢 Green Field (30m)
        🏏 Pitch (center)
```

### **AFTER:**
```
🏟️ Stadium Wall (65m)
  🏏 Boundary Rope (55m)  
    🟢 Green Field (50m) - FULL COVERAGE
      🏏 Pitch (center)
```

## ✅ **Visual Improvements**

### **What You'll See:**
1. **🟢 Complete green grass** covering the entire 50m playing area
2. **🚫 No brown/dirt patches** in the middle of the field  
3. **🏏 Professional cricket ground appearance** 
4. **📏 Clean boundary separation** - green field ends just 5m before boundary rope

### **Technical Change:**
```javascript
// UPDATED in src/constants/cameraViews.js
export const STADIUM_CONFIG = {
  field: {
    radius: 50, // CHANGED: 30m → 50m for full green coverage
    height: 0.1
  },
  boundaries: {
    innerRadius: 55, // Boundary rope
    outerRadius: 65, // Stadium wall
