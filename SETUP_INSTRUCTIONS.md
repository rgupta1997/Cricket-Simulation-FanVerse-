2. Make sure you're accessing `http://localhost:3000` (not opening HTML file directly)
3. Ensure all dependencies installed with `npm install`

### If players don't move:
1. Check console for debug messages when pressing keys
2. Make sure you're clicking in the game window first (to focus it)
3. Try different camera views with number keys 1-6

### Performance Issues:
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best Three.js performance
- Close other browser tabs if the game runs slowly
- Try pressing `C` to switch between basic and 3D stadium models
